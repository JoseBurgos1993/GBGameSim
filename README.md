GameBoy Game Simulator

Thoughts:<br />
Do I really need the sprite layer to contain a thousand tiles? Couldn't I just have a list of all sprites, and then one by one draw them at the correct corridinates on screen?
The window layer can probably stay ineffiecient I guess since it shouldn't update very often.
